1. COLUMN CHART - basic editing, title modifying
2. STACKED COLUMN CHART - legend, data labels
3. PIE CHART - pick columns whcih have less than 5 values
             - so in pie chart, legend extra work, so we use cosmetics - detail labels - all (40), then yeet legend 
4. DONUT CHART - same as up
5. FUNNEL CHART - higher size higher sales, basic funnel
6. Ribbon - F (x axis years type of data)
7. STACKED COLUMN - inlcude and exclude, used to compare two enititties, filter values visuallly
8. IMPORT & EXPORT - How come data is exactly 70k? Select right click - show data pt sa table (dammmmmmmm) 
                   - Exportable to csv 
                   - we can edit permission for end user as required (options - current fule - report settings)
 


SIMPLE MAP - we need geographical data type
iffy because format needs to be exact,  column tools - data category 
Drag states in location and then put sales in bubble size 

FILLED MAP - profit in legend gives wayy to mny colors for presentations use, so we do regions
           - If you want to give each state a color, put states in legend, we can see actual legend to crosscheck this
           - k so hovering shows us state and region, if we want extra like profits we drop it in tooltips


PIE CHART MAP - we put states then increase bubble size 
              - Now we want to see each states category wise distribution - many many peace, sales into size we observer the proportion in most pie charts changes, see legend for more clarity


FORMATTING MAP - in visual format, we can fk around with the color of bubble and even assign each state particular color
               - we can also find around with the categrory labels, background etc
               - inc dec bubble size, map controls like zoom, border, title, tool tip editing (hover to see effect)

BACKGROUND CHANGES - state wise sales, visual style - arial, dark
    
MAP OF INDIA - we can have state, postal code, country etc data as input, if not recognized, go to data category
             - basically if we have right data, ez to make a map

MAP OF AUSTRALIA - this time we have small table, so we copy data and do enter data
                 - we aint doing all that but careful it is not excel file



TABLE AND MATRIX

SIMPLE TABLE - just pick and put all u need in the columns option
             - In order to sort asc or desc, just click the "sum of quantity" thing, req no of times

FORMAT TABLE - yoink it - right click copy visual
