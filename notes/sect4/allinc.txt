

we want data models, no data models means bad
so bascially, without data modelling, we cannot seek the features of a different csv wrt another csv

normalization - eliminates redudanct data, minimize erros and anamolies, simplifies queries, preserves data integrity

each table serves a disctict and specific ppurpose only.

in data modelling, two tyoes if tables - facts and dimensions
facts - data tables, contain numeric values
dimension - lookup tables, contain descriptive attributes

the dimension tables are reffered to as master tables 
the fact tables are referred to as transaction tables

these are connected with the help of keys

ok so now in the model view, we first declare all the primary keys
and yeah mashing all of tables into a single table is not the math

fact table - foreign key
dimension table - primary key

time to wire, two ways
1. click and drag
2. detect relationships / manage relationships

autodetect ass

matrix issue - ok so what happens is while making a matrix of two categories from different tables instead of nice values we get the grand total being repeated for all the items present

fixes the matrix issue from before, i dunno if i mentioned it, i did not mention it
trivially easy to edit delete and recreate relationships here, unlike fking sql

star schema - single fact other dimension tables
snowball schema - extension of star, relationships (chain) btwn lookup tables

active/inactive relationships - there can only exist one active relationship btwn two tables, other inactive one will be inactive
                              - both can never be active at the same time
                              - to make other active, first deactive the active one by unchecking the box then activate the one u want, can also be toggled via properties
                              - adv of inactive relation is more clarity, useful in dax functions


cardinality is the uniqueness of the values in the column
types - 1-1, 1-m, m-1, m-n, visible via symbol, also in properties

well so we cant draw relationship between two fact tables, a SHARED dimension lookup table helps us establish that

so if we try to full vlaues via a shared dimension, we get the required matrix
however if we try to pull values via an unshared dimension table, we can see the repeating grand total value which indicates error

filter context and flow - the cardinality arrow shows filter direction
                        - ie the filter context only goes from a dimension table to a fact table not the other way
                        - filter context can only go downstream not come upstream
                        - pretty much repeating grand total = u messed up

bi directional filtering - updating the cross filter direction from single to both allows the filter context to flow in either direction
                         - can be edited via edit relationship or properties
                         - so previously, we saw repeating grand total error for wrong combinations, however if both filter is used, no error comes
                         - however this may lead to issues like missing records from a particular table which is quite wrong
                         - we need to exercise caution using this since using multiple both filter context will lead to ambiguity, ie brainfuck, luckily power bi shows error for this
                         - ambiguity means passing conflitcing filter context to a table

long story short, stick to 1-1 and 1-m as much as possible, refrain from using m-m unless absolutely necessary


hiding fields - makes fields inaccessible in report view, but still accessible in model and data views
              - hide foreign keys from users so they are forced to filter based on primary keys
              - we can hide table also
              - u can see the final effect of thisin the report view data panel, that shit is goneee

assignment filter flow - fuck
                       - ok so while creating a matrix the product key from different queries leads to different matrices, now that im writing this down i appear to be a buffoon :/


model layouts - just different views of the same model, not duplicates
              - if we make change in one view all other views get changed, ie everything is synced
              - if we wanna yeet, dont click delete from model, click remove from diagram
              - add related tables option hard carry
              - he has removed but i will be keeping this


data formats and categories - data type determines how the data is stored
                            - data formats determines how the data gets displayed
                            - can be accessed via properties in model view or better use data view
                            - change fields like date and currency, geographical shit like country continent etc
                            - fun fact: county- area in british yada yada


heirarchies - create like a heirarcy, highest to lowest for the report to be a banger (continent->country->region)

best practices - focus on building normalized model, ie all tables shld have clear and distinct ppurpose
               - organize dimension tables, prioritizing downstream 
               - avoid m-n relations, if necessary gl hf
               - hide primary keys from users cuz why not, now if sm shit is broken we know what we will be doing
