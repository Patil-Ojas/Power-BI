keys - attribute to identify unqiue tuples of a table
eg - student registration number / aadhar number

all possible options is called set of cadidate key
primary key is selected from this set of candidate key
left out keys are alternative keys

primary key = unique + not null

foreign key - references primary key, table can have multiple fk's 
            - maintains referential integrity
            - ie, maintains same value across all database

types of attributes - single / multivalued
                    - simple / composite
                    - stored / derived
                    - key / non-key
                    - required / optional 


Cardinality / Types of Relationship - Relationship btwn two entities
                                    - One to One -- given two tables emp and dept
                                                 -- the new table works will have the pks of BOTH tables as columns
                                                 -- each employee works for a single company and for each company there is an employee working for it
                                                 -- neither pk can be repeated
                                                 -- either of the pk can become the pk of combined table
                                                 -- the works table can be merged to either of the two tables (2 final tables)
                                    - One to Many -- given two table customer and orders
                                                  -- a single customer can give many orders
                                                  -- but an order can be placed by one customer only
                                                  -- the new pk of gives HAS to be the pk of the M side, ie orders
                                                  -- gives and orders can be merged into a single table (final 2 tables)
                                    - Many to One -- Reverse of One to Many
                                                  -- Many side pk will be new pk
                                                  -- may side table will merge with middle table (final 2 tables)
                                    - Many to Many -- given two tables student and course
                                                   -- a student can take multiple courses
                                                   -- a course can be registered by multiple students
                                                   -- study table will have pk from both table, but the pk of study will be the composite of the two pk's
                                                   -- these tables cannot be merged (final 3 tables)
