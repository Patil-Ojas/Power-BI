
Data visualisation woooo

perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

three key questions - What type of data (geospatial (maps), time series(line charts), heirarchial (tree maps), financial (f))
                    - What do we wanna communicate (comparison, composition, relationship, distributioin)
                    - Who is our end user (analyst, boss, executive, general public)

wakey wakey

framework - dashboards can consolidate data, track key metrics, facilitate data driven story telling
          - purpose, metrics, present data, eliminate cluster, layout, clear story

Two reading patters - F and Z
                    - so top left is most imp
                    - so it will be logo, followed by most imp like kpis
                    - get granular as u move on, ie start adding more details
                    - so below symbol chart then bar them matric and so on
                    - left bar to jump to maps, product details, customer details
    
Nice fonts - seigo ui (kpis)

on object formatting - bar, column, area, line, ,combo, scatter, so we know these better
                     - this is that good shit

transperancy diff

no trend line and forecast :/

holy date diff

kpi visuals

tc of units

filtering options - visual level
                  - page level
                  - report level (impacts entire dashboard)
                  - drill thru (different)

for any STATIC anamolies in the data, just deselect that option in filters xd

anything over 3 or 4 filters - hide

honestly shoudl have done based on the customer key but this looks better

aight do not use something where primary key can be used lmao

slicers - visual filters for report pages

hasonevalue - honestly this will not be useful unless the databse is quite small, so like very low use cases sooooo, skipped

guage chart - usedd to compare a value against a goal or a target
            - we pair this up with slicers to give end user options 

damm area chart hack

drill up and drill down between levels of granularity in charts, like month week day - drill up, drill mode, forked down
                                                                                     - dammm drill mode diffff
                                                                                     - weeks can be buggy, so either disable drill mode :/ or get rid of start of week
                                                                                     - edit most charts to have heirarchy cuz its cool

drill through filter - select a filter on one page and drill thru to another page to find stats of that particular filter
                     - also kinda diff, but idts  we gonna be able to use this

report interactions - filter, highlight, none
                    - powerbi guess ass
                    - sometimes hihglight dont work cuz of top n, make real world tradeof if needed

bookmarks - captures the current state of the report along with the filters and allows users to come bacc to it too using report actions
          - so make bookmark then breate button then placeit 
          - selct the bookmark in action, then make sure to use default, hover and press actions
          - so we can also point out intriguing trends to showcase

custom navigation - get excited
                  - aight so we will need to use a new page to set these up
                  - cleannnnn

custom slicers - if we kinda wanna filter the entire dashboard for a certain filter with a button, like continent wise etc
               - we dont wanna mess with other filters when filtering via these slicers so uncheck data 

numeric range parameter - automatically does heavy duty dax creates measures and makes a slicer on its own 
                        - now WE need to make measure acc to this generated measure for the slicer to work

field parameter - simpler than numeric range, select fields for slicer, this creates a measure
                - now connect this clicer with the visual by dragging in the new DAX, woo dynamic chart
                - we can now format chart for each slicer value individually
    
custom tooltips - to get custom tooltips make new page page info tooltip, canva settings [225x425], canva background, then edit this but some bar chart, transperancy 0, annnd
                - goddammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
                - aight i see u 
                - then hide the tooltip page

importing custom visuals - insert, more visuals, appsource visuals (approved by microsoft)
                         - animated bar race, add
                         - ohhhhh the yt race thinggyyy
                         - EXACTLY THE SAME THING LMFAOOO, nahhh we gotta do this shit
                         - search up yt for banger visuals, this does feel childish tho

managing roles - basically perms for viewing data
               - defined on power bi desktop, but service is where we can assign these roles to people
               - another crazzy thing


mobile layout - we cant build in mobile view, we can inly assemble in it
              - opens doors to power bi service


best practice - 3 key questions
              - simplicity, focus on intuitive user experience
              - custom mobile layouts if we plan to publish
